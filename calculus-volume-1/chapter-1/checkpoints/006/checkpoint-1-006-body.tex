\subsection*{Checkpoint 1.6: Application Involving a Composite Function}

\subsubsection{Instruction}

If items are on sale for 10\% off their original price, and a customer has a coupon for an additional 30\% off, what will be the final price for an item that is originally x dollars, after applying the coupon to the sale price?

\subsubsection{Solution}

Since the sale price 10\% off the original price, if an item is $ x $ dollars, its sale price is given by
$$ \phantom{.}
f(x) = 0.90x
.$$
Since the coupon entitles an individual to 30\% off the price of any item, if an item is $ y $ dollars, the price after applying the coupon, is given by
$$ \phantom{.}
g(y) = 0.70y
.$$
Therefore, if the price is originally $ x $ dollars, its price after applying the coupon to the sale price will be
$$ \phantom{.}
(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = (0.70)0.90x = 0.63x.
.$$

\subsubsection{Answer}

$ (g \circ f)(x) = 0.63x $.
