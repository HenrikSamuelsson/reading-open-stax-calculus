\subsection*{Checkpoint 1.19: Placing a Ladder}

\subsubsection*{Instruction}

A house painter wants to lean a $20$-ft ladder against a house. If the angle between the base of the ladder and the ground is to be $ 60 \degree $, how far from the house should she place the base of the ladder?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The ladder, ground, and house wall will form a right triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the length of the ladder, $20$-ft. We are also told that the angle between the ground and the ladder is $ 60 \degree $. And we want to know how far from the house the base of the ladder is placed, this will be length of the leg adjacent to the $ 60 \degree $ angle in our triangle.

Let H be the length of the hypotenuse, $A$ the length of the adjacent leg, and $ \theta $ be the angle. Then by using the known relationship $ cos \theta = A/H $ we can find the distance from the base of the ladder to the house as
\[ \phantom{.} A = cos(\theta) \cdot H = cos(60 \degree ) \cdot 20 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 = 10 \text{.} \]

Where the information that $cos(60 \degree)$ equals $ 1/2 $ is stated in the book, but can also be found in other ways such as by using a scientific calculator.

\subsubsection*{Answer}

$10$ ft.
