\subsection*{Exercise 1.1.57}

\subsubsection*{Instruction}

The manager at a skateboard shop pays his workers a monthly salary $ S $ of \$750 plus a commission of \$8.50 for each skateboard they sell.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item
    Write a function $ y = S(x) $ that models a workerâ€™s monthly salary based on the number of skateboards $ x $ he or she sells.
  \item
    Find the monthly salary when a worker sells 25, 40, or 55 skateboards.
  \item
    Use the INTERSECT feature on a graphing calculator to determine the number of skateboards that must be sold for a worker to earn a monthly income of \$1400. (Hint: Find the intersection of the function and the line $ y = 1400 $.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item
    The workers have a base salary plus a commission based on number of skateboards sales. The function will be the constant base salary plus a product depending $ x $ being number of skateboards sold,
    $$ \phantom{.}
    y = S(x) = 750 + 8.50 \cdot x
    .$$
  \item
    Having the formula from above we can calculate monthly salary for the different amount of skateboards sold,
    $$ \phantom{,}
    S(25) = 750 + 8.50 \cdot 25 = 962.5
    ,$$
    $$ \phantom{,}
    S(40) = 750 + 8.50 \cdot 40 = 1090
    ,$$
    $$ \phantom{.}
    S(55) = 750 + 8.50 \cdot 55 = 1217.5
    .$$
  \item
    Using a graphing calculator to graph our function and the liny $ y = 1400 $ we note that there will be two lines than intersect at the point $ (76.47, 1400) $. We can conclude that a worker will need to sell 77 skateboards to earn \$1400.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Answer}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item
    $ y = S(x) = 750 + 8.50 \cdot x. $
  \item
    \$962.5, \$1090, \$1217.50.
  \item
    77 skateboards.
\end{enumerate}
