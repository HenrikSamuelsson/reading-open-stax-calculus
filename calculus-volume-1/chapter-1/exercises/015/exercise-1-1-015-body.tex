\subsection*{Exercise 1.1.15}

Find the domain, range, and all zeros/intercepts, if any, of the function $ g(x) = \sqrt{8x - 1} $.

\subsubsection{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]

  \item
    The domain of the square root function is $ \left[ 0, \infty \right) $, which implies $ 8x - 1 \ge 0 $. Solving for $ x $ gives $ x \ge \frac{1}{8} $.

  \item
    To find the range of $ g $, we note that $ \sqrt{8x - 1} \ge 0 $. Therefore, the range of $ g $ must be a subset of the set $ \{y \mid y \ge 0\} $. To show that every element in this set is in the range of $ g $, we need to show that for a given $ y $ in this set, there exists a real number $ x $ in the domain such that $ g(x) = y $.

    Let $ y \ge 0 $. Then $ g(x) = y $ if and only if
    $$ \phantom{.}
    \sqrt{8x - 1} = y
    .$$

    We are interested in $ x $, and will solve this equation for $ x $. Since $ y \ge 0 $ such an $ x $ could exist. Squaring both sides of this equation, we have
    $$ \phantom{.}
    {8x - 1} = y^2
    .$$
    Therefore, we need
    $$ \phantom{.}
    8x = y^2 + 1
    ,$$
    which implies
    $$ \phantom{.}
    x = \frac{y^2 + 1}{8}
    .$$
    We just need to verify that $ x $ is in the domain of $ g $. Since the domain of $ g $ consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to $ 1 / 8 $, and
    $$ \phantom{.}
    \frac{y^2 + 1}{8} \ge \frac{1}{8}
    ,$$
    there does exist an $ x $ in the domain of $ g $. We conclude that the range of $ g $ is $ \{ y \mid y \ge 0 \} $.

  \item
    To find the zeroes, solve $ g(x) = \sqrt{8x - 1}0 $. We discover that $ g $ have one zero at $ x = -1/8 $.

  \item The y-intercept is given by $ (0, g(0)) $. Since $ x = 0 $ isn't in the domain of $ g $, it follows that that there aren't any intercepts.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer}

Domain = $ x \ge \frac{1}{8} $, range = $ \{ y \mid y \ge 0 \} $, zeroes $ x = -1/8 $, no intercepts.
