\subsection*{Review Exercise 1.310}

\subsubsection*{Instruction}

Is it true or false that a function is always one-to-one?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

A function is one-to-one if $ f(x_1) \ne f(x_2) $ if  $ x_1 \ne x_2 $. The function $ f(x) = x $ is an example of a function that is one-to-one. An example of a function not being one-to-one is the function $ f(x) = x^2 $, for which $ f(1) = f(-1) = 1 $. We conclude that it is false to say that a function is always one-to-one.

\subsubsection*{Answer}

False.
