\subsection*{Review Exercise 1.310}

\subsubsection*{Instruction}

Is it true or false that $ f \circ g = g \circ f $, assuming  $ f $ and $ g $ are functions?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The composition of two functions is not necessarily commutative, meaning that the order we apply the functions will matter. We can sse that it is false that $ f \circ g = g \circ f $ by computing the two compositions with two simple functions, $ f(x) = x + 1 $ and $ g(x) = x^2.
