\subsection*{Review Exercise 1.311}

\subsubsection*{Instruction}

Is it true or false that $ f \circ g = g \circ f $, assuming  $ f $ and $ g $ are functions?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The composition of two functions is not necessarily commutative, meaning that the order we apply the functions will matter. We can see that it is not always true that $ f \circ g = g \circ f $ by computing the two compositions with two simple functions, $ f(x) = x + 1 $ and $ g(x) = x^2$.

\[ \phantom{,} (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = x^2 + 1 \text{,}\]
and
\[ \phantom{,} (g \circ f)(x) = f(g(x)) = g(x + 1) = (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \text{,}\]

We get different results for the two compositions. Thus it is clearly not always true that $ f \circ g = g \circ f $.

\subsubsection*{Answer}

False.
