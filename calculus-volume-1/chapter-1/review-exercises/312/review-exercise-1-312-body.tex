\subsection*{Review Exercise 1.312}

\subsubsection*{Instruction}

Is it true or false that a relation that passes the horizontal and vertical line tests is a one-to-one function.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

A relation that passes the vertical line test is a function, since each input has exactly one output. If it also passes the horizontal line test, then each output comes from exactly one input. Therefore, it's a one-to-one function.

\subsubsection*{Answer}

True.
